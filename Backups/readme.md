# Backups
Backups from sample data inserted into tables.  
Backups are present in two forms, individual and full[^1].
## **Folders**:
### Full
Entire backup compressed into a single SQL file.
### Individual
Each table backed-up separately.  
[^1]: Both folders contain *identical* data. The backups are simply in different forms.
