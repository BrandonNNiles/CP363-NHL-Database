# SQL Code
SQL code which can be executed directly or in a terminal such as SQL Workbench.  
## **Files**:
### example-queries.sql
Some sample queries that users may use to gather information from the database.  
The main focus of this file is to show some common use-cases for the database.
### init-db.sql
Deletes (if needed) and creates all tables.  
This file essentially initializes the database by creating all tables with no entries.  
This file should be ran **once** to create all tables, and then ignored afterwards.
